* About

We wil use simpleFoam and scalarTransportFoam to simulate the flow through a square cross section T pipe and calculate RTD (Residence Time Distribution) for both inlets using a step function injection.

*Objectives:*
 + Understanding RTD calculation using OpenFOAM.
 + Using multiple solvers for a simulation.

* Setting up the case:
