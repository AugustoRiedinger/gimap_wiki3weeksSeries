* About:
https://wiki.openfoam.com/index.php?title=Grid_convergence_by_Jozsef_Nagy

We will cover one of the basic concepts in OpenFOAM. The resolution of your mesh might have an influence onto the results of your simulation. This tutorial will give you a feeling about the importance of grid resolution and how to avoid deviations caused by coarse grid resolution. We will cover

+ field initialization with setFields
+ mesh refinement with blockMesh
+ simulation of a 1D shock tube case
+ influence of mesh refinement on the simulation results
+ post processing

For older versions of OpenFOAM the blockMeshDict file is located in constant/polyMesh, for newer versions the file is located in system.

Newer versions of OpenFOAM do not use the sample command, instead you can use postProcess -func sample.
* Background:

** Initial and boundary conditions:

Before running the numerical solver, it is important to set up initial and boundary conditions  correctly for the problem. Ill-defined boundary conditions will result in non-convergence or  incorrect results.

The initial conditions provide the starting values for the solver and once specified, the value is put  into the center of every cell in the whole domain. As the solver starts to run, the initial values will  be replaced by newly calculated values. Any starting values can be used for 1st iteration. However  the better the initial values, the faster the convergence. Initial conditions are mandatory for transient  problems, but not absolutely required for steady state problems.

On the other hand we need to also provide boundary conditions. These will connect the simulation  models with its surroundings. The values specified are located at the boundary faces of the domain,  where their solution will be kept unchanged during the simulation, as the solver will not calculate  them. Most boundary conditions are either steady state or transient.

In OpenFOAM®, we can use the setFields utility to specify a non-uniform initial condition, and this  will be the focus of Tutorial Three. In addition, the boundary conditions are specified in the files in the /0/ directory.

** Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition:

In this tutorial, we will create meshes with 100, 1000 and 10000 cells in one dimension. However,  one cannot simply increase the number of cells (i.e. decrease the cell size) without changing the  time step size accordingly. This is because when running a numerical scheme (e.g. the Gauss linear  scheme; more details can be found in Tutorials Four and Five), the solution is reached using the  information propagated by waves or particles from one cell to the adjacent cell. To ensure a  physical solution it is essential that the physical flow information e.g. velocity, composition, etc. is  received by all cells within the calculation domain. It needs to be guaranteed that the information  transport does not “overtake” the physical transport, otherwise the scheme will be unable to access  the information required to form the solution.

The above criteria is known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, and it is a necessary condition for convergence. For one-dimensional problems, it can be written as:

\begin{equation}
   C_o = \frac{\mu \Delta t}{\Delta x} \leq 1
\end{equation}

The key dimensionless number here is the Courant number, $C_o$, which need to be less or equal to one.

As it is obvios from the equation, by decreasing the mesh size (i.e. $\Delta x$), the time step size $\Delta t$ should also be adjsuted (decreased) for reaching a stable and convergent solution. Therefore the CFL condition i suseful in helping us choose a suitable time step size for our simulation. A common way of selecting the time step size is to keep the Courant number at 1, using the maximum possible $\mu$ and the smallest possible mesh size, and a $Delta t$ that fits the criteria can be calculated.
* Simulation:

Use the /rhoPimpleFoam/ solver; simulate 0.007 seconds of flow inside a shock tube, with a mesh with 100, 1000 and 10000 cell in one dimension, for initial values 1 bar/0.1 bar and 10 bar/o.1 bar.

*Obejectives*:

+ To understand the /setFields/ utility.
+ Learn how to specify initial and boundary conditions.
+ Investigate effect of grid resolution.

*Data processing*:

+ Import your simulation into ParaView, and compare results.

** Pre-processing:

*** Open tutorial:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle preprocessing
:END:

Copy the tutorial from the folling directory to your working directory:

#+begin_src bash
cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/compressible/rhoPimpleFoam/laminar/shockTube/ .
#+end_src

** Mesh with 1000 cells:

*** Pre-processing - Editing blockMeshDict:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle 01shockTube_1000/system/blockMeshDict
:END:

We will edit the first file in /01shockTube_1000/system/blockMeshDict/:

#+begin_src C++
FoamFile
{
    format      ascii;
    class       dictionary;
    object      blockMeshDict;
}

convertToMeters 1;
#+end_src

After leaving the vertices (wich define the mesh) as a default:

#+begin_src C++
vertices
(
    (-5 -1 -1)
    (5 -1 -1)
    (5 1 -1)
    (-5 1 -1)
    (-5 -1 1)
    (5 -1 1)
    (5 1 1)
    (-5 1 1)
);
#+end_src

We will take a look at the /blocks/ section:

#+begin_src C++
blocks
(
    hex (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (1000 1 1) simpleGrading (1 1 1)
);
#+end_src

Here we can see that the number of mesh cell in the /y/ and /z/ direction is one (1D mesh), so what we look at is the /x/. The default number of cells in the mesh 1000 for the /x/ direction, wich is what we need for the first case, so we leave it as it is.

The rest of the file remains the same:

#+begin_src C++
edges
(
);

boundary
(
    sides
    {
        type patch;
        faces
        (
            (1 2 6 5)
            (0 4 7 3)
        );
    }
    empty
    {
        type empty;
        faces
        (
            (0 1 5 4)
            (5 6 7 4)
            (3 7 6 2)
            (0 3 2 1)
        );
    }
);

mergePatchPairs
(
);
#+end_src
*** Running the simulation:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle 01shockTube_1000/run
:END:

First, the mesh needs to be created:

#+begin_src bash
blockMesh | tee log.blockMesh
#+end_src

In order to assign the default values for pressure, temperature and velocity which were set in the /setFieldsDict/:

#+begin_src bash
setFields | tee log.setFields
#+end_src

We now create a dummy file:

#+begin_src bash
touch open.foam
#+end_src

And execute the solver to run the simulation:

#+begin_src bash
rhoPimpleFoam | tee log.rhoPimpleFoam
#+end_src
*** Post-processing - Results:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle postProcessing
:END:

First, we open the dummy file with ParaView in the background:

#+begin_src bash
paraview open.foam &
#+end_src

Then, we evaluate the different parameters. We will export every second (frame) as a picture. For this, in ParaView go to /File -> Save Animation .../ and save the diffent results as /*.png/ files. The files should have been saves with 4 decimals (as a default), i.e.:

+ p.0000.png
+ p.0001.png
+ p.0002.png
+ ....

As an example with the pressure /p/.

We can use /ffmpeg/ to create a video out of the images:

#+begin_src bash
ffmpeg -framerate 1 -i p.%04d.png p.mp4
#+end_src

And the same can be done for /U/ and /T/.

[[file:01shockTube_1000/images/p.mp4]]
#+CAPTION: Pressure with a 1000 blocks mesh

[[file:01shockTube_1000/images/T.mp4]]
#+CAPTION: Temperature with a 1000 blocks mesh

[[file:01shockTube_1000/images/U.mp4]]
#+CAPTION: Velocity with a 1000 blocks mesh

** Mesh with 100 blocks:
*** Pre-processing - Editing blockMeshDict:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle 02shockTube_100/system/blockMeshDict
:END:

We'll edit /02shockTube_100/system/blockMeshDict/:

#+begin_src C++
FoamFile
{
    format      ascii;
    class       dictionary;
    object      blockMeshDict;
}

convertToMeters 1;

vertices
(
    (-5 -1 -1)
    (5 -1 -1)
    (5 1 -1)
    (-5 1 -1)
    (-5 -1 1)
    (5 -1 1)
    (5 1 1)
    (-5 1 1)
);

blocks
(
    hex (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (100 1 1) simpleGrading (1 1 1)
);

edges
(
);

boundary
(
    sides
    {
        type patch;
        faces
        (
            (1 2 6 5)
            (0 4 7 3)
        );
    }
    empty
    {
        type empty;
        faces
        (
            (0 1 5 4)
            (5 6 7 4)
            (3 7 6 2)
            (0 3 2 1)
        );
    }
);

mergePatchPairs
(
);
#+end_src

Note that we changed the /x/ direction of blocks to 100.
*** Running the simulation:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle 02shockTube_100/run
:END:

This step will be pretty much the same as the last case; we'll create the mesh with /blockMesh/, then set the initial values with /setFields/ and finally run the simulation with /rhoPimpleFoam/.

#+begin_src bash
blockMesh | tee log.blockMesh
setFields | tee log.setFields
touch open.foam
rhoPimpleFoam | tee log.rhoPimpleFoam
#+end_src

Remember that you have to be in the main directory to run the previoys commands.
*** Post-processing - Results:

We open the dummy file /open.foam/ with ParaView like the previous case. We can see that the mesh has much less points than the last:

[[file:02shockTube_100/images/mesh.png]]
#+CAPTION: Mesh with 100 blocks

Then, we export the images for /p/, /U/ and /T/ and make videos from them:

[[file:02shockTube_100/images/p.mp4]]
file:02shockTube_100/images/U.mp4
file:02shockTube_100/images/T.mp4

We can see the difference in the animations.
