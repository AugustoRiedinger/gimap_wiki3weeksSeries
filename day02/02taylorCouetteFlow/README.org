We will take a look at a compact description of a well known flow from literature. In this tutorial you will run a simple steady-state simulation, where you can directly compare the quality of your results with literature values.

You can download the case files here.

In this tutorial we focus on:

+ case, geometry and mesh setup
+ boundary conditions
+ solution evaluation and post processing
+ comparison with theory and experiments from literature

* Background:
** Case, geometry and mesh:
What is a case? A case is the combination of:

+ *Gemoetry definition:* the finite volume mesh.
+ *Configuration files:* dictonaries.
+ *Definitions:* boundary conditions and initial conditions.

And this is organized into directories:

+ *0:* contains the initial and boundary conditions.
+ *constant:* contains material and turbulence properties.
+ *system:* contains most configuration files, such as /controlDict/ that has the parameters for the simulation, and /blockMeshDict/ that establishes the initial mesh.

In older versions of OpenFOAM, the initial mesh used to be in /constant/polyMesh/. This case will use the older organization of files.

* Setting up the case:

The case can be downloades from: https://rheologic.net/sites/default/files/downloads/taylor_couette.tar.gz.

Once downloades, you can extract it with:

#+begin_src bash
tar xvf case.tar.gz && rm case.tar.gz
#+end_src

And rename it as the base case:

#+begin_src bash
mv taylor_couette 00baseCase
#+end_src

If we create a dummy and open it with ParaView:

#+begin_src bash
touch open.foam
paraview open.foam
#+end_src

we can see the initial geometry:
