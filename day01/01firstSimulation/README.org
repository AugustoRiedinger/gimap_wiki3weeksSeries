#+TITLE: First simulation in OpenFOAM

You will learn about:

+ the basic case setup of OpenFOAM
+ the initial values of your simulation
+ the mesh (e.g. the boundaries)
+ running the simulation of the flow in a 2D elbow case with three different meshes
+ post processing

  You will familiarize yourself with the terminal in Linux, where you will run all your simulations in OpenFOAM. You will also get a first idea on the work flow that you have to follow in order to run a successful simulation.

* Setting up the environment:

Fist, copy the elbow tutorial from:

#+begin_src bash
/opt/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v9/tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/elbow
#+end_src

to your working directory.
