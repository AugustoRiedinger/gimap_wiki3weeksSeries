#+TITLE: blockMesh With a More Complicated Case:
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes

* ABOUT:

[[https://wiki.openfoam.com/index.php?title=BlockMesh_by_Jozsef_Nagy]]

You will get a detailed introduction into the dictionary describing the input of blockMesh. This time we will use a more detailed geometry of the forwardStep. You will learn about

+ scaling the mesh
+ setting the vertices
+ setting volumes (blocks)
+ setting edges
+ boundaries
+ grading

We will also run and post process the case, however the focus is on the meshing part of a CFD project.

Remeber that for older versions of OpenFOAM the blockMeshDict file is located in constant/polyMesh, for newer versions the file is located in system.

* Using rhoPimpleFoam solver:
/rhoPimpleFoam/ is a transient solver. It solves trans-sonic/supersonic flow of a compressible gas/fluid. The objectives are as following:

+ Understand /blockMesh/.
+ Define vertices via coordinates as well as surfaces and volumes via vertices.
+ Data processing:
  + Import your simulation into ParaView and examine the mesh and results in detail.

** Setting up the case:
*** Copying tutorial:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle setup
:END:

We copy the tutorial from the following folder to the current working directory:

#+begin_src bash
cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/compressible/rhoPimpleFoam/laminar/forwardStep/ .
#+end_src

** Running the simulation:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle forwardStep/run
:END:

Before running the simulation, the mesh has to be created. In the previous step, the mesh and the geometry data were set. For creating ir the following command should be exceuted from the case main directory:

#+begin_src bash
blockMesh
#+end_src

After that, the mesh is created in the /constant/polyMesh/ folder. For running the simulation, type the solver name from the case directory and exceute it:

#+begin_src bash
rhoPimpleFoam
#+end_src
** Post processing:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle forwardStep/postProcessing
:END:

First, we create a dummy file:

#+begin_src bash
touch open.foam
#+end_src

And to open the results in ParaView:

#+begin_src bash
paraview open.foam
#+end_src

Here we can see the mesh and the three blocks which were created:

When a cut is created by default in ParaView, the program shows the mesh on that plane as a  triangular mesh even if it is a hex mesh. In fact, ParaView changes the mesh to a triangular mesh  for visualization, where every square is represented by two triangles. For avoiding this when

The simulation results are as follows:
