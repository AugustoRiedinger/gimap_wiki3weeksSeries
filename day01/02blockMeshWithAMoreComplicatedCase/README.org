#+TITLE: blockMesh With a More Complicated Case:

[[https://wiki.openfoam.com/index.php?title=BlockMesh_by_Jozsef_Nagy]]

You will get a detailed introduction into the dictionary describing the input of blockMesh. This time we will use a more detailed geometry of the forwardStep. You will learn about

+ scaling the mesh
+ setting the vertices
+ setting volumes (blocks)
+ setting edges
+ boundaries
+ grading
+ We will also run and post process the case, however the focus is on the meshing part of a CFD project.

For older versions of OpenFOAM the blockMeshDict file is located in constant/polyMesh, for newer versions the file is located in system.
