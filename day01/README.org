#+TITLE: DAY 1

Day 1 is all about fast and fun simulations with the focus on

+ the basic workflow in OpenFOAM
+ getting used to the terminal
+ meshing with the OpenFOAM internal meshing utility blockMesh
+ running simulations
+ first steps with postprocessing in Paraview

* FIRST SIMULATION

In this tutorial you will get a first hands-on glimpse into the workflow of CFD simulations with OpenFOAM.

+ basic case setup
+ initial values
+ mesh
+ simulation (2D elbow case with three meshes)
+ postprocessing

* BASIC CASE SETUP

Using icoFoam solver, simulate 75 s of flow in an elbow.

+ Basic case setup in OpenFOAM
+ Setting up initial values of p and U
+ Ensuring proper boundary definitions
* OPENFOAM BASICS

Here you will find a video on the very basics of OpenFOAM. You will hear about

+ OpenFOAM and what it is good for
+ the history and philosophy behind it
+ the basics and the structure.
* SESSION A: GETTING TO KNOW OPENFOAM

In this tutorial you will study

+ what is the history of OpenFOAM
+ the philosophy behind the OpenFOAM software
+ what is the content of the OpenFOAM software package
* blockMesh WITH A MORE COMPLICATED CASE

In this second tutorial video you will try out your knowledge about blockMesh in order to create a more complicated mesh for a simulation. The focus is on:

+ scaling the mesh
+ setting the vertices
+ setting volumes (blocks)
+ setting edges
+ boundaries
+ grading
* CAVITY - REVISITED

Before you already completed this tutorial a few times. Here you will be taken into the depth of an OpenFOAM case in order to understand all the important in- and outputs required for a CFD simulation in OpenFOAM.

+ details on OpenFOAM directory organization
+ directory structure of an application/utility
+ applications/utilities in OpenFOAM
+ directory structure of an OpenFOAM case
+ simulation workflow
+ details on the in- and output of an OpenFOAM case
